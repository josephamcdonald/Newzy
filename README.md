## Acknowledgements

The theme is inspired from the [New Zealand All-of-Government Brand](https://www.ssc.govt.nz/govt-brand).

For example, [their official typeface (Fira Sans)](https://www.govt.nz/about/about-this-website/style-and-design/typography/#typefaces) is used throughout this app. The colors are inspired from [here](https://www.govt.nz/about/about-this-website/colours-images-and-logos/).

Black, white, gray and the Māori red are all represented. Loved the red contrast so much so that I used it for the app's "colorAccent." Some great info on the [Māori flag](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/national-maori-flag).

A huge "thank you" to Heather. As a social media authority, she is an excellent resource for me to get ideas and feedback on my apps!
